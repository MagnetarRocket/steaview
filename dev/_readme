-This is the dev(ice) directory, the following prefixes are used for files:

fb : framebuffer, access to the local system framebuffer framework.

pfb: pesudo-framebuffer, while it acts like a framebuffer, it however 
	is more of a wrapper for the underlining graphics subsystems of target platform.

	A good example would be OSX.

mouse: rawer mouse accesss. in /mouse, mouse layers use "m-" as a prefix.

_readme: this readme file.

-postfix clarifcation:

dragon: dragonflyBSD, might be added in later on.

free: FreeBSD.

open: openBSD

net: netBSD

sunOS: illumos

OSX: Mac OS (X), support for it is put on hold for now, will have active support when others request it.
