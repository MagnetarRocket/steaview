This is the dev(ice) directory, the following prefixes are used for files:

fb : framebuffer, access to the local system framebuffer framework.

pfb: pesudo-framebuffer, while it acts like a framebuffer, it however 
	is more of a wrapper for the underlining graphics subsystems of target platform.

	A good example would be OSX.

mouse: rawer mouse accesss.

_readme: this readme file.
